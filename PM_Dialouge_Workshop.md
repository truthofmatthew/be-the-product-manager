# Excessive Thinking

## Interpretation vs. Reality

| What is - Fact                 | What we think   - Opinion                    |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Red.                         | Perfect for a healthy snack.           |
| There.                        | Reminds me of my childhood.            |
| On the desk.                  | Too sour.                              |
| Round.                        | Overpriced.                            |
| Has a stem.                   | Represents temptation.                 |

# From Perception to Fragmentation

Our perceptions often differ from reality, causing fragmented thinking and incomplete decisions. Bohm’s dialogue **bridges** these gaps, offering clearer choices and helping unify perspectives. It’s not about winning a debate, but about understanding each other and building meaning together.

</hr>

| Perception                             | Reality                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Sales drop due to new feature release.    | Competitor launched a marketing campaign.        |

# What is Dialogue?

Dialogue is when people share ideas and listen without defending their own views. It’s about understanding each other, suspending judgment, and creating meaning together. It’s not a debate—it’s about finding **shared understanding**.

</hr>


| Term       | Definition                                          |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
|Dialogue   | A cooperative exchange aimed at mutual understanding.   |
| Debate     | A competitive argument where each side defends its point of view. |
| Negotiation| A discussion to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  |
| Conversation| Informal exchange of ideas or information between people. |

# Effective Dialogue Principles

- **Suspension of Judgment & Listening to Understand**  
   In meetings, let everyone share their thoughts before deciding.

- **Whole-System Thinking & Collective Intelligence**  
  When planning a new feature, get input from multiple teams, not just development.

- **Co-Creation & Exploration**  
  In brainstorming, ask, "What if we tried this?" to get everyone involved.

- **Flow of Thought**  
  Let discussions unfold before refining them into action points.
