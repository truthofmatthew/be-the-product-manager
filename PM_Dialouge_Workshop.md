# From Perception to Fragmentation
What we think is often far from what reality is. This gap in understanding is a key factor in the fragmentation of thought. David Bohm's work on fragmentation highlights how this division prevents us from seeing the whole picture.


---

# When the World Falls Apart
## Why We Prefer to Break Things Up

---

# Fragmentation and Its Impact on Decision-Making
Fragmented thoughts lead to decisions based on incomplete information. Dialogue, according to Bohm, helps connect these ideas and gives us a clearer, more complete view. This improves our decision-making.

# Fragmentation vs. Wholeness

---

# **Fragmentation**  

## 💡 We break things into pieces.

David Bohm believed our thinking divides reality into fragments. This limits understanding and prevents seeing how everything fits together.



---



# **What does fragmentation mean?**

- It’s when things are broken into disconnected fragment.

- Like focusing on fragments of a story without seeing the full picture.

# **The Broken Watch**

- Gears, Glass, Hands.


---

# Dialogue: Bridging the Gap
Dialogue helps us bridge gaps by sharing ideas and perspectives. It’s not about winning a debate, but about understanding each other and building meaning together.

---

# What is Dialogue?

Dialogue is when people share ideas and listen without defending their own views. It’s about understanding each other, suspending judgment, and creating meaning together. It’s not a debate—it’s about finding **shared understanding**.

---

## Suspension of Judgment

In meetings, listen to all ideas before forming an opinion. Let team members share thoughts on a new feature before deciding its worth.

---

## Whole-System Thinking

Think about how decisions affect the whole team. When planning a feature, consider how it impacts marketing, support, and sales, not just development.

---

## Co-Creation of Meaning

Encourage everyone to share ideas and build on them. Example: In planning, ask input from all teams to shape priorities together.



---

## Listening to Understand

Focus entirely on the speaker without planning your response. Listen fully when a colleague explains a problem, and only then offer your input.

---

# How Dialogue Works

## Exploration

Ask open-ended questions and avoid jumping to conclusions. In brainstorming, ask, “What if we tried this?” instead of dismissing ideas immediately.

---

## Flow of Thought

Let conversations unfold naturally without interruptions.In discussions, allow ideas to develop before narrowing down to the best solution.

---

## Collective Intelligence

More perspectives lead to better solutions. In strategic decisions, involve people from different departments to enrich your insights.


---

# How Dialogue Influences Decision-Making
The decisions we make are shaped by how well we communicate. Dialogue fosters a deeper understanding of different viewpoints, enabling us to make informed, collaborative decisions.

# The Power of Decision-Making

### 5 Ways to Lead Conversations
🔹 Understand who makes the final decision.  
🔹 Use the right approach for better communication.

# Decision-Making Framework

| **Type**          | **Accountability**  | **Intention**      | **Who Decides?**      |
|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **No Decision**   | Inform 🗣️          | Tell 📢            | No one yet            |
| **Your Decision** | Delegate 👥         | Guide 🧭           | The other person      |
| **My Decision**   | Consult 💬          | Listen & Ask 👂    | You                   |
| **Our Decision**  | Reach Consensus 🤝  | Facilitate Dialogue 💬 | Both (Consensus)      |
| **Each Decision** | Explore & Align 🔍  | Engage in Dialogue 🗨️ | Both, separately      |



---

### "No Decision" (Inform)  
✅ **You’re sharing info. No one decides yet.**  
💡 Example: *"I found some cool places for the weekend."*  
💡 Product Example: *"We’re exploring AI-generated playlists."*

---

### "Your Decision" (Delegate)  
✅ **You trust the other person to decide.**  
💡 Example: *"You pick where we go!"*  
💡 Product Example: *"Task the data science team with analyzing reactions to AI curation."*

---

### "My Decision" (Consult)  
✅ **You ask for input, but you decide.**  
💡 Example: *"What do you think of the beach? I’ll decide if we go."*  
💡 Product Example: *"Consult the legal team about user data handling before making a decision."*

---

### "Our Decision" (Consensus)  
✅ **You both discuss and decide together.**  
💡 Example: *"Let’s pick a place we both like."*  
💡 Product Example: *"Hold a cross-functional meeting to decide on the product's next step."*

---

### "Each Decision" (Dialogue)  
✅ **You make separate decisions but align them.**  
💡 Example: *"You pick the hotel, I’ll handle the activities."*  
💡 Product Example: *"Design picks the UI, engineering handles the infrastructure, while both ensure they align with the overall product vision."*

---

# Planning a weekend trip:

1️⃣ No Decision: Just sharing ideas
2️⃣ Your Decision: Letting your partner choose
3️⃣ My Decision: Asking for input, but making the final choice
4️⃣ Our Decision: Agreeing together
5️⃣ Each Decides: You pick hotels, they pick activities
